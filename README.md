# MyCart

RFID-based smart shopping and billing systems in clothing stores, powered by IoT and RFID technology, are poised to redefine the shopping experience for customers. This innovative system leverages Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags attached to the price tags on clothing items and RFID readers integrated into smart shopping baskets to create a frictionless and efficient billing process. By seamlessly integrating RFID-based smart shopping baskets and mobile applications, this solution aims to revolutionize traditional clothing store shopping, eliminating queues and streamlining the entire shopping process.


MyCart allows users to log in if they already have an account. If the customer doesn't have an account, they can register. After logging in, the customer needs to connect to a basket/cart, and then they can view the items in basket/cart.
